 * Note: Pusher client dependency was not added to the project to avoid build
 * failures in this environment. To enable real Pusher support:
 * 1) Add the official Pusher Java server dependency to build.gradle
 *    e.g. implementation 'com.pusher:pusher-http-java:<version>'
 * 2) Uncomment and configure the bean below to create the Pusher client.
 * 3) Set pusher.enabled=true and provide credentials in application.properties.
